## Jane, the gamemaster

I am currently running two D&D games on alternating weekends.  Between them, I have to keep track of around thirty named NPCs, not to mention the nameless characters I've generated to serve as extras.  It would be helpful if there were a single online portal where I could keep track of all these characters.

## Jeff, the player

I've been playing D&D since middle school.  It's fun to get together with friends and use our imaginations to tell stories together, but I also like creating characters even when I don't have a game to run them in.  I'd really like a website where I could add, remove, or update characters whenever I think of them.

(Both of these stories are part of MVP).
