# Weekly Reflections

## Week 1

Chose a topic for my project; began thinking about the layout.

## Week 2

Created the elevator pitch.

## Week 3

Created repository, readme, gitignore, and project structure.

## Week 4

Create wireframes and .jsp files.  Choose background (#F2ECDA) and font (Trebuchet MS, Verdana, sans-serif).

My approach so far has worked for setting up the bare bones, but I need a more consistent approach as I move forward.  From this point on, my goal is to set aside at least one hour a day to work on this project.
