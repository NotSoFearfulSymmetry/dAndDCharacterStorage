# D & D Character Storage
This is a Java-based web application for keeping track of Dungeons &amp; Dragons characters.

## Problem statement

Dungeons & Dragons is an immensely popular tabletop roleplaying game.  As such, it functions both as a way for people
to spend time with their friends, engaging in a shared hobby, and as an outlet for individual creativity.  In the
latter capacity, D & D can be a mixed blessing: the more characters one creates, the harder it becomes to keep track
of them.  To that end, this application will stand independently of any online platform for playing D & D, and will
allow its users to keep track of their characters from anywhere in the world.

In addition to having access to all characters of their own creation, users will have the option of sharing a given
character with another registered user, so that both of them have permission to retrieve, update, or delete that
character.  Typically, this will be used to share a character between a player and a gamemaster, though it could
also be used to share a character with another player.
