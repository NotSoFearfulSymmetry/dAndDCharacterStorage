# D & D Character Storage
This is a Java-based web application for keeping track of Dungeons &amp; Dragons characters.

## Problem statement

Dungeons & Dragons is an immensely popular tabletop roleplaying game.  As such, it functions both as a way for people
to spend time with their friends, engaging in a shared hobby, and as an outlet for individual creativity.  In the
latter capacity, D & D can be a mixed blessing: the more characters one creates, the harder it becomes to keep track
of them.  To that end, this application will stand independently of any online platform for playing D & D, and will
allow its users to keep track of their characters from anywhere in the world.

There will be two types of user-access permissions: player and gamemaster.  A player will have access to all the
characters he or she has created, while a gamemaster will have access to all the characters associated with the
game or games that he or she is overseeing.  It will be possible for users to create multiple accounts, so that a single
user might be a player in regard to certain characters, and a gamemaster in regard to others.  Both players and
gamemasters will have the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete characters to which they have access.
